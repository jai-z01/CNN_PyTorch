# CNN_PyTorch
CNN model implemented with Pytorch module on CIFAR-10 dataset
This is a Convolutional Neural Network model consisting of two layers of Linear and one layer of Relu. 
The Neural Network uses Categorical Crossentropy as loss function and SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent) as optimizer.
The model gives an accuracy of 82.594 % for the train data.
